    this class loads  the sql database and puts each block of data into a hash map in the form of the <Integer, String[]>
    the integer part is the id and the rest are stored in the string list
    this is where the program starts main()!

    all hashmaps are public so we can use them along the classes and in the end it calls treatement()
