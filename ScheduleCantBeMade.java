    If it is not possible to create a schedule, the program should report
the problem so that Sara can contact the staff vet to request a change of requirements. As the staff vet
may not be on site, Sara needs to be able to modify the start hour of one or more of the treatments
based on the advice she receives. The new schedule should be created after the database is updated.
